# PDMATLAB2D
## A simple, educational 2D MATLAB implementation of peridynamics

The PDMATLAB2D code is a meshfree peridynamics implementation in MATLAB suitable for simulation of two-dimensional fracture problems. The current version implements a bond-based brittle elastic peridynamic model and a critical stretch criterion for bond breaking. PDMATLAB2D provides an entry-level peridynamics computational tool for educational and training purposes. It also serves as an accessible and easily modifiable computational tool for peridynamics researchers who would like to adapt the code for a multitude of peridynamics simulations.

## Run

Examples can be run by passing an input file to the top-level function:
```
PDMATLAB2D('WavePropagation')
PDMATLAB2D('CrackBranching')
```

Tests are located in the `Tests/` folder and can be run individually to check individual components.

Individual plots can be created (as in the paper below) from the `PlottingExamples/` folder. Plots can be easily generated within the folder via the function `PlotPaperFigures'.
